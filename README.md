# Super Pillow Fighter

school final project from ye olden times: pillow-fighting smash-brothers clone

Super Pillow Fighter was my final project at school like a thousand years ago, and published in the Moondance IGF 2006 Compilation CD. 

Still runs on modern PCs! I haven't looked at the source code in forever so good luck, but like wise man say "It's easier to compile a decade-old C++ program, than a Ruby app from 6 months ago."

Today, it would probably take all of twenty minutes to knock this game out in Unity and push it through greenlight. This is why I LOL whenever widdle babies start crying about the "indie bubble", because this is the type of shit indie game dev had to deal with not even ten years ago. To make the game, tens of thousands of lines of low-level C++ so close to bare metal it was practically written with a chisel. To actually get the game in front of players, byzantine contract negotiations with shady-ass publisher sleaze. So spare me the "indiepocalypse", I ain't hearing that mess. Wanna go back to writing custom memory manager singletons and vector math libraries, be my guest... been there, done that, uphill both ways in the snow. YOU KIDS OFF MY LAWN!

Cheers!
